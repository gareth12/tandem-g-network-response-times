Tandem G-network response times
===============================

The code in this repository implements the results in
* *[Response Time Distributions in Tandem G-Networks](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3214932)* by  Peter G. Harrison and Edwige Pitel, Journal of Applied Probability, Vol. 32, No. 1, Mar., 1995 pp. 224-246.

The current implementation of the code works correctly in the region R_{L_e\L} intersect R_C only, and not in R_L.
